Tutorial - Example1.5: Customizing Logging
=======================================
## Summary
This sample demonstrates changing the logging level. This changes the log level for the SDK across all the processes in the SDK.
There is a maximum logging level available which differs between the debug and release builds.
In debug builds the maximum log level is DEBUG, while in the release build the maximum log level is ERRORS. The minimum logging level is
called "OFF", but at this level a few criticial items are still logged from the SDK.
