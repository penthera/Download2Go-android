/**
 * This implements the IForegroundNotificationProvider interface, which enables notifications to be built
 * within the service process so they do not need to cross the process boundary. Notifications created in the service starter
 * would be passed in an intent over the process boundary into the service process, and this introduces limitations due to the
 * size of object that can be passed over that boundary. This object is instantiated within the service process instead,
 * so no limitations exist on the way the notifications are used, but the process should be considered. Any resources which
 * are required to generate the notification will need to be loaded within this process as they cannot be shared with the process
 * which contains the UI.
 *
 * This example uses the same Factory class to generate notifications. Please remember this is a
 * separate instance of the NotificationFactory, running within a different process than the traditional one in ServiceStarter.
