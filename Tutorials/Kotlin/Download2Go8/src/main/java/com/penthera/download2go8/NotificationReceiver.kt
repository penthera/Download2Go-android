/**
 * This component receives progress events in the client app whilst files are downloading.
 * Notifications can be received for events and for basic downloader operations like starting and
 * stopping downloads.
 *
 * Filter the notifications required here by adding them to the intent-filter for this
 * component in the application manifest.
 *
 * Here we demonstrate using the received notifications to send a sample foreground notification
 * back to display via the service as the default foreground notification. This approach can be used
 * for all foreground notification updates, but a more efficient method is to register a notification
 * provider with the service which will enable generation of the foreground notifications within the
 * service process directly. That approach is also demonstrated within ServiceStarter.kt
