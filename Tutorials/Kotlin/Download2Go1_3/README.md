Tutorial - Example1.3: Engine Status
====================================
## Summary
This sample demonstrates how to fetch engine status from the SDK, including the current values for download status, disk usage, download throughput, and the secure clock time used by the SDK.
If the engine is in a blocked download state then the sample demonstrates how the SDK indicates the cause for being blocked such as network, storage, or battery.
